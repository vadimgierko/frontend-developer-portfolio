Thanks to that your notes are linked with each other & grouped by tags. You don't need to put your notes into folders or do any index or table of content anymore! You can easily find your note by filtering notes by one or more tags thanks to search engine (of which I'm proud ;-) You're saving a tone of time to organize & efficiently use your notes! At the moment this SPA is available for my personal use only. I couldn't manage hunderds of my notes, so I've decided to build this app and I'm happy, that finally I've solved one of my biggest problems thanks to my own app. You can see some of my notes, but cannot sign up at the moment or modify my database. App is still is still being developed, growing & tested by me, so when right time comes, I'll enable creating accounts for users like you ;-)",

So now, after 10 months brake I've figured all bugs & problems out, so the game is finally completed! I love working with p5.js, which alows you to create animations like this in that game, and thanks to this library I've made my first steps in programming learning with Khan Academy online courses, so it was a pleasure to come back to old habbits after 10 months of working mainly with React & other technologies ;-) Car's design was inspired by drawing of my son!

				"This Christmas Online Animated Musical Card was made using Javascript & p5.js library. To make the animation seem more realistic, I created a pseudo 3D illusion thanks to basic knowledge of perspective: 1). there are 3 layers of snow, 2). more distant snowflakes are smaller, while closer are larger, 3). more distant snowflakes fall slower, and closer ones fall faster. In addition, I've implemented noise effect (noise() in p5.js) to falling snow, so now it seems to fall more naturally, and mountains. And finally, there are 4-sized trees: randomly positioned after each page reload, more distant trees are smaller & darker, closer trees are lighter & bigger. Let it snow!",
