# Hello, World! That's my front-end developer portfolio v4!

Click here to see the [portfolio site](https://vadimgierko.github.io/frontend-developer-portfolio) version 4 deployed with Github Pages!

## Recent redesigning & refactoring

Recently (May 2022) I've totally redesigned & refactored the portfolio for the fourth time! If you're interested in how 2 previous versions looked & functioned like (the first version was permanently deleted), see branches in this repository.

This time I've made huge changes:
- [X] totally new site design (less words, more icons, custom projects slider, more space & better RWD)
- [X] cleaner & simplified components (also because of switching from Bootstrap to React Bootstrap & React Icons)
- [X] new sections:
  - [X] extracted from About: About/Hero Section, Tech Stack, What Can I Build,
  - [X] brand new: Currently Learning

## Tech Stack

- [X] react
- [x] react-bootstrap (replaced bootstrap in prev versions)
- [x] react-icons (replaced bootstrap icons in prev versions)
- [X] gh-pages

## To Do in the future (a list for myself)
