# Hello, World!

My name is Vadim Gierko and Iâ€™m a **self-taught React / Firebase developer** with
- more than a year of non-commercial programming experience &...
- an artistic, blogging and musical background.

And this is my portfolio repository!
To see the portfolio deployed with Github Pages click this link: https://vadimgierko.github.io/frontend-developer-portfolio/

## What you'll find in my portfolio
- languages, frameworks, technologies & tools I use
- what kind of projects I love to develop the most
- my top projects
  - screenshots
  - descriptions
  - links to live versions of projects
  - links to gh repos
- details about my creative background
- what else I'm interested in

## Technologies used in project
- React 17.0.2
- Bootstrap 5.1.1
- Bootstrap Icons 1.5.0
- Github Pages 3.2.3

## NOTE
This portfolio definitely isn't one of my top projects at the moment, but recently I've improved the project by applying:
- dark/light mode
- Atomic Design methodology
- better code splitting, refactoring etc.

Now I will most likely make two huge fixes / updates:
- completely new "Bootstrap free" design with CSS Flexbox & Grid Layouts & styled components
- create CMS & integrate it with the portfolio via Firebase
