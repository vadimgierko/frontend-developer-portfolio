# Hello, World! That's my front-end developer portfolio repo v4!

## Recent redesigning & refactoring

Recently (May 2022) I've totally redesigned & refactored the portfolio for the fourth time! If you're interested in how 2 previous versions looked & functioned like, see other branches in this repositoirum.

This time I've made huge changes:
- [X] totally new site design (less words, more icons, custom projects slider, more space & better RWD)

  - [X] extracted from About: About/Hero Section, Tech Stack, What Can I Build,
  - [X] brand new: Currently Learning
